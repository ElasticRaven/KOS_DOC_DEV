See [ship control](../../summary_topics/ship_control/index.html) for a full explanation for how to control flight.  This page is a placeholder for the time being because so many other places in the documentation still point to it instead of the new page.

Sets game warp to provided value(0-7).

    SET WARP TO 5.      // Sets warp to 1000x.
    SET WARP TO 0.      // Sets warp to 0x aka real time.
